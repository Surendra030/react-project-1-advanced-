## 🎯 About

This Movie Application allows users to explore movies and TV shows by listing popular, trending, and upcoming content. Created as a project to practice using modern frontend technologies, it leverages React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, and Redux Toolkit for a smooth and interactive experience.

## 💎 Features

- Browse lists of movies and TV shows
- Search functionality for finding specific movies or shows
- Detailed views for each movie/show, including credits, reviews, and trailers
- Watch full-length movies directly in the app (powered by an integrated video API)

## ⚠️ Note
- This app integrates a video API service, similar to a paid API experience, to allow users to watch full-length movies directly within the app. This feature is powered by VidSrc, a free video API provider.
